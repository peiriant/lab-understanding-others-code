1. Seperate out the print statements more so it's clearer for the player with "\n".
2. Make it one player, make the dealer react in reaction to their cards.
3. Asking for the ace value repeatedly. Should stop after count is above 10. 
4. Put the main game logic into a function? 
5. Convert the variable assigned to keep_playing from a string to a boolean (True), so that game loops with a True / False argument.
6. Add concept of betting to the game, with virtual money.

1. Writing the relative path instead of the full path because it doesn't work on someone else pc
2. Error handling, while loop to check users input
3. Define a function for choosing the random word
4. Print the number of attempts left for the player
5. Checking if the letter occurs more than once in the word to match the number of correct letters
